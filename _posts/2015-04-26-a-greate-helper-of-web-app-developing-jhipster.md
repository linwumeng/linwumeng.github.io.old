I found a very interesting tool for the new Web project which is named [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io).

I generate a sample [project](attachments/2015-04-26/book.7z).
The useful tools are [atom](../_files/2015-04-26/atom.zip) and [npm](attachments/2015-04-26/npm.7z), [npm modules](attachments/2015-04-26/node_modules.7z).
